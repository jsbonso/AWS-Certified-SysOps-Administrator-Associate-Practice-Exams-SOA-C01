Some people are using brain dumps for the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate exam which is totally absurd and highly unprofessional because these dumps will not only hinder you from attaining an in-depth AWS knowledge, these can also result with you failing the actual AWS certification exam since Amazon regularly updates the exam coverage.

Please also note that these AWS practice tests are not brain dumps and since Amazon shuffles the actual exam content from a question bank with 500++ questions, it is nearly impossible to match what you can see here with the actual tests. Again, the key to passing the AWS certification exam is a good understanding of AWS services and this is what our AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate practice tests are meant to do.

These AWS SysOps Administrator Associate practice exams are designed to focus on the important exam domains such as Monitoring and Metrics, Security and Compliance, Networking, and Deployment and Provisioning, hence, the aforementioned topics have more questions than the other domains/knowledge areas. The number of questions on each topic are carefully selected based on the domains listed in the official AWS SysOps exam guide.

There are a lot of existing AWS Practice Tests in the market, however, most of them contain both technical and grammatical errors that may cause you to fail the actual exam. There are also official certification practice exams provided by AWS but these only have 20 or 40 questions and cost 20 or 30 USD -- a price that is comparable with having these 325 Unique and Timed Amazon Web Services practice questions!

We gave a considerable amount of effort to create and publish these AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate practice tests, including the laborious task of checking each item for any errors. We are confident that this will significantly help you pass your exam. All the best!

## IMPORTANT NOTE

These AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate practice exams have a passing score of 72% but we highly encourage you to repeat taking these exams again and again until you consistently reach a score of 90% or higher on each exam.

Remember that using this product alone does not guarantee you will pass the exam as you still need to do your own readings and hands-on exercises in AWS. Nonetheless, these practice exams provide a comprehensive assessment on which knowledge area you need improvement on and even help you achieve a higher score!
